# tourism-price-prediction
Probelm Statement - 
Tanzanian tourism sector plays a significant role in the Tanzanian economy, contributing about 17% to the country’s GDP and 25% of all foreign exchange revenues. 
The sector, which provides direct employment for more than 600,000 people and up to 2 million people indirectly, generated approximately $2.4 billion in 2018 according to government statistics. 
As I started to find the data I came across this dataset through an competition hosted by Zindi website.
In this project I’m predicting how much money a tourist will spend when visiting Tanzania?

Objective - 
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict what a tourist will spend when visiting Tanzania. The model can be used by different tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board to automatically help tourists across the world estimate their expenditure before visiting Tanzania.
